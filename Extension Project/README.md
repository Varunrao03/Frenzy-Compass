# Wrap Around Scraper

In this phase of our project, we’ll be diving into web scraping to gather data from two key sources: the Wikipedia page "Michelin-starred Restaurants in San Francisco" and the "Restaurants in San Francisco" page from TravelTriangle. Our goal is to analyze and compare the information presented on our platform with these well-established sources.
By doing so, we aim to assess the accuracy and completeness of our restaurant listings, ensuring that users receive the most reliable recommendations. If we find discrepancies, whether outdated information, missing restaurants, or inconsistencies in ratings. We’ll use these insights to refine our data and improve our software’s credibility.
